title: Welcome to my blog, bitches.

    Chapter one. 
For some people, it might be a normal thing to write a journal or blog ... not for me.
This is my first time (that's what she said). 
I'm not entirely sure why I am doing this. But just pretend that I'm Mark Zuckerberg working on Facebook and blogging parallel to it.  
Film recomendation - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network" target="_blank">"The Social Network"</a>

Today I wanna cover a few topics
- how I set up my website (pippo.tech) and this blog
- In any case I need a cheatsheet for markdown, because this blog uses markdown lol.
- a side project which was the original reason to start a website and ended up on a website, a blog and no started project.

I just went to take a shit and thought that it would be better to separate the three topics in a blog entry for each topic.
Oh and a need Grammarly, because this shit is in English and I am not able to write it without help.

So plan for today is to set up the cheat sheet (it's gonna be Chapter zero)... hm nah that's boring, I'll do this another day.
So plan for today is to talk about how I set up the website and the blog. Afterwards, I need to tell you about this project
which should be ready this afternoon. Spoiler - it's not gonna be ready. Not even close.  
But first, I need to browse a bit to make this post a little bit more attractive. Well, that did not work out - let's keep it ugly.



## I'm gonna keep this in case I will share some code with you later on.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui";
import theme from "./theme";

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
);
```
