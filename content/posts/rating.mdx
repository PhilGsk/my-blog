A few thoughts about a little side project. A web app where you can create an account and rate movies/series/books/audiobooks/podcasts you watched/listened (following called as **medium**).
I want to realize it with Django (python). So its gonna be a server-side rendered web app.
Data-Modell might be like this:
| Users           |
| --------------  |
| + ID            |
| + NAME          |

| Medium          |
| --------------  |
| + ID            |
| + NAME          |
| + TYPE          |
| + RELEASEYEAR   |
| + DATE-WATCHED  |
| + IMAGEURL      |

MVP only. Some thoughts about features that could be added. 
So normal procedure if you want to watch a new medium:
- browsing hours through your streaming provider
- if you click on a medium that might be interesting you see a rating based on hundreds of people you don't even know
- if the rating is not that good you might give it not even a try

The problem I want to solve is to see just relevant reviews/ratings. You can follow people who have the same taste as you when it comes to mediums. 
So you can see mediums that people watched, that you are following and see their rating.

TODO:
- define MVP
- Obviously whole back and frontend with Django
- decide which DB (SQL, NoSQL, graph)
- find API or write a script to get all movies/series etc.
