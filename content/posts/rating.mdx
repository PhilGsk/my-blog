title: Rate Movies And Series - Python Project

A few thoughts about a little side project. A web app where you can create an account and rate movies/series/books/audiobooks/podcasts you watched/listened (following called as **medium**).
I want to realize it with Django (python). So its gonna be a server-side rendered web app.
Data-Modell might be like this:

| Users           |
| --------------  |
| + ID            |
| + NAME          |

| Medium          |
| --------------  |
| + ID            |
| + NAME          |
| + TYPE          |
| + RELEASEYEAR   |
| + DATE-WATCHED  |
| + IMAGEURL      |
| + STREAM        |

MVP only. Some thoughts about features that could be added. 
So normal procedure if you want to watch a new medium:
- browsing hours through your streaming provider
- if you click on a medium that might be interesting you see a rating based on hundreds of people you don't even know
- if the rating is not that good you might give it not even a try

The problem I want to solve is to see just relevant reviews/ratings. You can follow people who have the same taste as you when it comes to mediums. 
So you can see mediums that people watched, that you are following and see their rating.

TODO:
- define MVP
- Obviously whole back and frontend with Django
- decide which DB (SQL, NoSQL, graph)
- find API or write a script to get all movies/series etc.

*UPDATE 25.05.2020*
So I started a Django project but still learning fundamentals of Python/Django.
A few days a go I thought about how I will get all the movies and series. So I googled a bit and found a website called "whostreamswhat" (in german). 
Basically this page got a DB with over 127k movies and about 60k series and provide them to show who is streaming what. (As the name suggests)
Wouldnt it be nice to get all the data from them? unfortunately I could not find an API because they use server-side-rendering.
A few weeks a ago I used a python script to crawl through Instagram so you get a list with the persons who are not following you back(https://www.blog.pippo.tech/python-project/).
I modified the code so the program crawl through the Website "whostreamswhat" and put all title, genre and release year in a list - that was quite easy.
I will paste the script below.

```jsx
from selenium import webdriver
from time import sleep


class InstaBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("https://www.werstreamt.es/filme/")
        sleep(2)


    def getMovies(self):
        self.driver.refresh()
        counter = 2
        i = 2
        while True:
            name = self.driver.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/div[2]/div/div/section/div/div/div/ul/li["+str(i)+"]/a/div[2]/strong")
            genreAndYear = self.driver.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/div[2]/div/div/section/div/div/div/ul/li["+str(i)+"]/a/div[2]/span")
            x = genreAndYear.text.split(", ")
            x.insert(0, name.text)
            #http request to insert it into a DB
            i+=1
            counter+=1
            if(counter == 21):
                self.driver.execute_script("window.scrollBy(0,1000)")
                i+=1
                counter = 2

my_bot = InstaBot()
my_bot.getMovies()
```
